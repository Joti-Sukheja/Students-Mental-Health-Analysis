## Data Cleaning and Dashboard Steps

### **1. Data Cleaning Process**  
Key steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis:  

- **Handling Missing Values**  
  - Identified and imputed missing values using logical assumptions or statistical measures like averages/medians.  

- **Standardizing Column Headers**  
  - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency (e.g., replaced underscores with spaces).  

- **Filtering Irrelevant Data**  
  - Removed duplicate or irrelevant rows to focus on meaningful insights.  
  - Retained only relevant columns, such as depression levels, age, gender, university, and stress-relieving activities.  

- **Categorizing Depression Levels**  
  - Classified depression levels into *High*, *Moderate*, and *Low* based on predefined thresholds.  

- **Formatting Data**  
  - Converted numerical values into percentages where applicable (e.g., gender-specific depression levels).  
  - Standardized date formats to ensure uniformity.

### **2. Dashboard Creation Steps**  
The following steps were followed to create the dashboard in Microsoft Excel:  

- **Importing the Dataset**  
  - Loaded the cleaned data into Excel.  

- **Using PivotTables**  
  - Analyzed key metrics using PivotTables, including:  
    - Depression levels by gender, degree, and university.  
    - Impact of sleep hours, sports, and financial concerns on depression.  

- **Creating Charts**  
  - Designed various charts to visualize insights:  
    - **Pie charts**: Depression levels by university and degree type.  
    - **Bar charts**: Impact of stress-relieving activities, sleep hours, and sports.  
    - **Horizontal bar charts**: Depression by age and gender.  

- **Designing the Layout**  
  - Structured charts and metrics into a cohesive, professional dashboard layout.  
  - Used clear titles, legends, and data labels for better readability.  

- **Final Formatting**  
  - Applied consistent colors, fonts, and design elements to enhance visual appeal.
